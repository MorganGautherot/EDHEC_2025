Here somme notes you took :\n","- Olist marketing teams need an actionable description of the segmentation that allows them to thoroughly grasp its underlying logic (Notebook format).\n","- The [database](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) contains information such as order history, products purchased, customer satisfaction comments, and location.\n","- The quality of the data is somewhat poor. The idea is to create the best possible features for making optimum use of them.\n","- Customer segmentation means understand the different types of users. Unsupervised algorithm is probably the best to use.\n","- The segmentation needs to be robust: adding a few new customers to the database and creating a new segmentation using the same model should not result in totally different conclusions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jP-D-hTYOrn1"},"source":["TIPS : Feel free to take inspiration from the notebooks available on Kaggle."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c1JhpkVnMxKU"},"source":["# 1.
